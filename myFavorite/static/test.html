   <h2>The result of the telemetry:</h2>
   <p>We want to send a low rate traffic from `h1` to `h2` and a high
   rate iperf traffic from `h11` to `h22`.  The link between `s1` and
   `s2` is common between the flows and is a bottleneck because we
   reduced its bandwidth to 512kbps in topology.json.  Therefore, if we
   capture packets at `h2`, we should see high queue size for that
   link.</p>
